    <h1 class="about__page__title">About This Website</h1>
    <p>There are many sites out there that teach you how to develop macOS and iOS apps. The targeted audience varies from the very beginner with no programming skills at all and all the way to the advanced developer with many years of experience. Some sites cover just the basics, others try to give you the full package.</p>
    <p>Some sites are doing a great job, but most fail to follow up with the frequent changes and the tons of new stuff introduced by Apple on a regular basis.  For the very same reason, I believe that most printed books covering computer technology in general, are out of date by the time they leave the print shop.</p>
    <p>In view of the above, you are justified in asking, how gabrielmiro.com which is a one man show, can be of real value to me. The answer to this question can be found in my background.</p>
    <p>Here is where gabrielmiro.com comes in. The goal of this site is to provide you with the missing pieces of the puzzle, and save you precious time and lots of frustration. Of course you will not find all the answers here, but I believe that as the site gains momentum more and more topics will be covered.</p>
    <p>To boost this effort I will also post on a regular basis links to the best sites, blogs, articles etc. in my opinion related to macOS and iOS.</p>
    <p>To conclude, gabrielmiro.com is a complementary site to all the learning tools of your choice. Come here when you hit a wall or just feel like exploring something with Going the Extra Mile</p>
    <p>gabrielmiro.com starts where other tutorials end.</p>

    <h2 class="about__page__title">My Background</h2>
    <p>My name is Gabriel Miro. By education I hold a B.Sc. in Physics, but after a few years in research as a physicist I found out that computers are my true destination.</p>
    <p>There is a long list of Operating Systems, languages, technologies, companies (large and small) I have worked with. I am an accomplished programmer, development manager, educator, speaker with over 40 years of experience. My expertise include Assemblers, Fortran, Cobol, C, C++, Object Pascal, Java, Objective-C, Swift, script languages, JavaScript and most web and mobile technologies. As for operating  systems my expertise covers older mainframes, the old Mac OS (pre macOS), and current platforms like macOS, iOS, Windows and linux.</p>
    <p>In particular, I am programming for the Mac since 1984 when the Mac was born. Between 1984-1998 I was the co-owner and dev lead of a Software Development House, that specialized in full scale multi-lingual word processors and desktop publishing apps for Mac OS.</p>
    <p>Since 2014 I am an indie iOS an macOS developer. In this new chapter of my life I am constantly studying in order to keep up with all the new stuff coming from Apple. Accordingly, I am familiar with all the major and more significant sites teaching development for macOS and iOS. As an accomplished educator and with the passion to teach others I have discovered that many important topics do not get the proper and full coverage, leaving the user with many doubts and open questions. In the best case this is just frustrating, but the worst case scenario is that the development process is on hold until the answers are found.</p>
